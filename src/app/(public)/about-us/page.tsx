        Everything runs in the browser—no plugins to install, no GPUs to
        maintain. Simply pay for the processing you use via <em>credits</em>,
        our lightweight credit system powered by Razorpay. Behind the scenes we
        rely on trusted infrastructure from Firebase (auth & hosting), Replicate
        (state-of-the-art ML models), and OpenAI (AI processing) to deliver fast, secure, and reliable results.
